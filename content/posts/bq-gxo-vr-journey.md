Today was genuinely exciting. B&Q and GXO brought two trainers and a hiring manager to campus alongside a full tractor unit. We could ask questions, take photos, and discuss VR training. They're clearly interested in what I'm building.

## Historic Passion for VR

I've always been fascinated by VR. The idea of immersive, simulated environments stuck with me long before it became mainstream. When the Final Year Project came around, I knew I wanted this to be my focus. It's one thing to follow a trend, another to genuinely care about the technology and its potential applications.

## Learning Unity

Unity hasn't been easy. Last year I struggled with it. The learning curve felt steep and progress seemed slow. But this project has forced me to push through those difficulties. I'm building a VR training environment for B&Q's Learning and Development Department to teach delivery drivers trailer uncoupling procedures. Working on something practical has made all the difference.

## The Project

I'm developing a trailer uncoupling simulator. Delivery drivers need to perform this procedure correctly every time. VR allows them to practice in a safe, controlled environment before they ever touch real equipment. No damage, no pressure, just learning through repetition and feedback.

## Today's Event

GXO does the training for B&Q. Today they brought the team and equipment directly to us. Walking around the tractor unit, seeing the actual hardware I'm simulating in VR – it brought everything together. The trainers answered questions about current training methods, pain points, and what they'd want to see improved. The hiring manager was genuinely interested in my work and the broader applications of VR training.

## Moving Forward

This project has shown me that VR training isn't theoretical anymore. Companies like B&Q and GXO are actively interested, bringing their teams and equipment to universities because they see real value here. The connection between my historic interest in VR and what I'm building now is finally concrete.
