## LinkedIn

Unfortunately for everyone, LinkedIn is a dominant force in the wonderful world of corporate capitalism. It's a behemoth of networking, considered invaluable and a bare minimum requirement to progress your career in any remotely techy or financey field, and is genuinely a very well made product. You have to hand it to them, the infinite scroll of self-congratulation and vague buzzwords is remarkably addictive.

LinkedIn was rather unceremoniously born in the living room of one Reid Hoffman, ex-founder of the now defunct SocialNet.com alongside his various colleagues of his various jobs in tech, quickly transforming from a simple idea to the professional world's favourite digital water cooler. LinkedIn's team quickly realised people didn't just want to network, they wanted opportunities and to brag about their lives in the hopes of opening up more opportunities, with it now transcending into the number one place where every newgrad claims their two-week-long ultimate expertise in whatever is the current JavaScript framework of the hour after completing chapter 1 of a Udemy course.

It's a cesspit, it's a snakeden, it's capitalism distilled into a gooey Microsoft-flavoured demi-glace, and unfortunately it's basically the only option if you want recruiters to slide into your DMs offering you 'exciting opportunities' that mysteriously lack a salary range.

## The Band Kid

Bit of a vibe-switch here, but I really like live music (controversial, I know!), but more specifically I adore amateur live music. A packed stage at a festival is fun and all, watching millionaires phone it in from half a mile away, but a dingy bar with some idiots on a stage playing music to a wonderfully human level is infinitely more inspiring and enjoyable. There's a certain magic to seeing someone wrestle with a temperamental amp or forget their own lyrics mid-song, only to be bailed out by their mate on bass. It's real.

Despite having no musical talent of my own (my brief attempt at the recorder in Year 4 resulted in something resembling a distressed pterodactyl), I've had the unique pleasure of befriending and dating a number of "band-kids" throughout my state-mandated education and beyond. The band kid is a unique phenotype of human, too awkward to fit in with the cool kids but just confident enough to slam a drum or strum a chord on a stage in front of a random assortment of their peers, often fuelled by lukewarm Carling and nervous energy. Watching a friend or lover produce harmonic excellence (or at least enthusiastic noise) from their hands and mouths never really gets old, and as someone with no talent myself I can't help but feel envious of them for their talents (though not envious enough to pick up an instrument, god no, not going that far. Effort.).

The band kid is dying out though, didn't you hear? GCSE Music entries have fallen [34% since 2015](https://www.classicfm.com/music-news/children-excluded-arts-education/), with A Level down [45% since 2010](https://www.rncm.ac.uk/news/the-day-the-music-dies-why-time-is-running-out-to-tackle-the-decline-in-uk-music-education/), primarily attributed to funding cuts to state education because apparently learning spreadsheets is more culturally enriching than learning sonatas. It's a crying shame, and one that **will** have long standing effects, likely resulting in a future where the only new music is algorithmically generated soundscapes designed to sell artisanal coffee. I'll try not to get political, but the current and past UK Government's seem to insist that these areas are not worth investment despite the UK Music Industry making record economic contributions, with the Gross Value Added reaching [£7.6B in 2023](https://www.thecreativeindustries.co.uk/site-content/record-year-for-uk-musics-economic-impact-and-employment), up 13% from the year before. Clearly, the strategy is to harvest the fruits while letting the roots wither and die. Bold.

Thankfully though, it's not just at the state education level that cuts are being made to music courses, with Cardiff University most recently unveiling its plans to [axe their music course offerings](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cx24p8r90gro). Because who needs trained musicians when you have Spotify playlists, right?

## What Can Be Done?

So, we've established LinkedIn is a soul-sucking corporate necessity and that the breeding grounds for future musicians are being systematically dismantled. Cheery stuff. Where does our endangered species, the Band Kid, fit into this picture when trying to, you know, *do* music?

Well, they could try LinkedIn. Imagine the profile: "Seeking Drummer for Noise-Rock project. Influences: Existential Dread, Pavement, Poor Life Choices. Skills: Hitting Things Rhythmically (mostly), Turning Up (sometimes), Owning Own Cymbals (cracked)." It doesn't quite mesh with the endless stream of "Thrilled to announce..." posts and synergy evangelists, does it? Trying to showcase your blistering guitar solo or that heart-wrenching ballad you wrote feels fundamentally absurd next to someone listing "Proficient in Microsoft Excel" as a key skill. LinkedIn is built for hierarchies, for job titles, for demonstrating quantifiable achievements that fit neatly into bullet points. It's like trying to use a spreadsheet to write a symphony. The tool just isn't built for the task.

## The Current Digital Toolkit (or lack thereof)

Okay, so LinkedIn is useless for our hypothetical noise-rockers. But surely they're not just relying on telepathy and hopeful glances across crowded bars? Well, yes and no. Musicians, being resourceful creatures born of necessity and often fuelled by instant noodles, have cobbled together a digital existence using the tools available.

There's the ubiquitous **Social Media swamp**: Facebook groups dedicated to "Musicians Seeking Musicians [Insert Town Name Here]" which range from surprisingly useful to utter chaos, populated by arguments about gear and people posting blurry photos of their cat. Instagram serves as a visual portfolio, great for aesthetics and short clips, but hardly ideal for finding a bassist available next Tuesday. You *can* promote gigs and releases, but good luck getting the algorithm to show it to anyone who isn't already a devoted fan or your mum. It's trying to find a needle (a reliable collaborator) in a haystack (influencer drama, targeted ads, endless baby photos).

Then you have the **Music Hosting Platforms**: SoundCloud and Bandcamp are essential for actually *sharing* the music. You can point people there, embed players, even sell merch on Bandcamp (bless its cotton socks). But they aren't networking platforms. Finding collaborators involves digging through comments sections or hoping someone stumbles upon your track and decides to reach out – it's passive, not proactive. Spotify for Artists and the like give you data, but they won't help you find a replacement guitarist when yours decides to move to Peru to 'find themselves'.

And yes, there are some **Dedicated Musician Sites**: platforms like JoinMyBand or Bandmix exist, functioning like dating profiles but for the musically inclined. They *are* purpose-built, often with useful filters for genre and location. But let's be honest, many feel a bit Web 1.0, have potentially smaller, less engaged user bases depending on your niche and locale, and lack the dynamic community feel or broader functionality needed. They often feel like the digital equivalent of a faded flyer on a damp noticeboard – functional, maybe, but hardly inspiring.

The reality for most musicians, producers, songwriters, engineers – pretty much anyone trying to actually create or facilitate music – is a fragmented juggle across multiple platforms. It's exhausting, inefficient, and none of these tools truly capture the specific networking, collaboration, and opportunity-finding needs of the entire music ecosystem in one cohesive place.

What the fragmented, underfunded, yet stubbornly passionate world of grassroots music *really* needs is its *own* space. Not a slick, corporate networking tool, but a functional, dynamic, digital equivalent of the best parts of the local music shop noticeboard, the backstage hang, and the supportive community zine, all rolled into one.

Imagine a platform designed for music people, by people who understand that "networking" can mean anything from finding a reliable bandmate to sourcing a specific vintage mic for a session, or connecting an artist with the right mixing engineer.
* **Portfolio First:** Profiles built around embedded audio (SoundCloud, Bandcamp links mandatory), videos of live performances (even shaky phone footage), decent photos (not necessarily corporate headshots).
* **Collaboration Hub:** Search filters for instrument, genre, location, influences, availability. Clear "Seeking [instrument/vocalist]" features. Maybe even a function for sharing song ideas or collaborating remotely on writing.
* **Gig Finder:** A dedicated section for venues/promoters to list open slots, and for bands to list their availability and tech specs. Think less "job application," more "digital gig swap."
* **Community, Not Corporatism:** Forums or groups for sharing advice (gear, recording, navigating the local scene), finding jam sessions, promoting shows without the cringeworthy self-promotion tone endemic to LinkedIn. A place to celebrate the small wins – the first gig, the finished demo, the successful mastering of a tricky riff.

With music education being squeezed from the top down, these informal networks and grassroots connections become even more vital. If the traditional pathways are being closed off, we need better tools to forge new ones. A dedicated platform could help musicians find each other, find opportunities, and build the small-scale scenes that are the lifeblood of any healthy music culture (and, ironically, feed the £7.6B industry the government simultaneously champions and undermines).

So, who's going to build the musician's anti-LinkedIn? Or are we just doomed to sift through the digital noise, watch talented people give up because they can't find the right collaborators, while the dingy bars slowly fall silent? Food for thought. Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to go and congratulate someone on LinkedIn for their basic AWS Cloud Certification, oh joy.
