I've made it to third year. The journey has been solid so far. I've learned a lot and despite some struggles, I feel I'm on the right track academically. My career prospects are a different story though. The tech industry is challenging right now and securing a good internship or graduate scheme has proven more difficult than expected.

Not landing any summer internships or placements last year was a setback for my confidence. I've been working to rebuild it and refocus on my studies, but it's challenging when the competition is fierce and it seems like everyone else has more experience and better connections.

## Concerns About the Tech Industry

I feel anxious about the future of the tech industry. With AI advancing so rapidly, I worry about what this means for software development careers. Will AI replace entry-level developers? Will the skills I'm learning become obsolete before I even graduate? It's concerning, but I'm trying not to let it hold me back. Instead, I'm focusing on things AI can't easily replace such as practical experience, real-world problem solving and human connections.

## What I'm doing differently

That said, I'm determined to make the most of my final year.

I've been serving as a Programme Representative for my course since the start of the academic year. It's been a great opportunity to contribute and I've found it valuable for developing my communication and leadership skills. I'm enjoying representing my cohort and feeding back to the department.

## Academic Progress

I've completed my group project successfully. We built an event management application for charities and NGOs using React Native and Django, and I served as Project Manager and Lead Developer. Our team achieved 75% overall, though I'm still waiting on my individual component mark. It was a challenging project that required coordinating multiple team members and optimizing resource allocation for charity events.

The Final Year Project with B&Q is progressing well. I'm developing a VR training environment for their Learning and Development Department to teach delivery drivers trailer uncoupling procedures. I found Unity challenging last year but this project has given me the opportunity to work through those difficulties and build something practical.

Business Intelligence module was reasonable, still waiting on the final grade.

## B&Q Update

The relationship with B&Q has continued to develop beyond the Final Year Project. We've been collaborating on several initiatives and the partnership is progressing well. I'm looking forward to sharing more about how this working relationship continues to evolve.

Overall, third year has been challenging but rewarding. The 75% on my Final Year Project is a strong result and has validated the hard work I put into it. The ongoing B&Q partnership continues to present opportunities, and I'm optimistic about where that might lead. While I still have concerns about the tech industry and AI, I'm focusing on the practical experience and real-world impact I can create. Looking forward to finishing the year on a high note.
