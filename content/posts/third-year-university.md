I've made it to third year. The journey so far has been solid. I've learned a lot and, despite some struggles, I feel I'm on the right track academically. My career prospects, however, are a different story. The tech industry is brutal right now, and securing a good internship or graduate scheme has proven incredibly difficult.

Failing to land any summer internships or placements last year was a significant blow to my confidence. I've been working to rebuild and refocus on my studies, but it's hard not to feel discouraged when the competition is so fierce and it seems like everyone else has more experience and better connections.

## Concerns About the Tech Industry

I can't help but feel anxious about the future of the tech industry generally. With AI advancing so rapidly, I worry about what that means for software development careers. Will AI replace entry-level developers? Will the skills I'm learning become obsolete before I even graduate? It's an unsettling thought, but I'm trying not to let it paralyze me. Instead, I'm focusing on things AI can't easily replace: practical experience, real-world problem solving, and human connections.

## What I'm doing differently

That said, I'm determined to make the most of third year.

I've been accepted as a Programme Representative for my course, which is a great opportunity to contribute and make a difference. It's early days and I have a training session coming up, but I expect it will strengthen my CV and develop useful skills.

## Academic Progress

I've completed my Final Year Project and it went really well – got 75% overall, though I'm still waiting on my individual mark. I developed a VR training environment for B&Q's Learning and Development Department to teach delivery drivers trailer uncoupling procedures. Found Unity challenging last year but this project was a great opportunity to prove I could overcome that difficulty. Working directly with a real company on something that will actually be used was incredible experience.

Business Intelligence went alright, but not sure yet – no mark yet.

## B&Q Update

Progress with B&Q is going well. The relationship has continued to develop beyond just my Final Year Project, and we'll be doing a dedicated blog post on that soon. Stay tuned for more details on how this partnership is evolving!

Overall, third year has been challenging but rewarding. The 75% on my Final Year Project is a strong result and has validated the hard work I put into it. The B&Q connection continues to be promising, and I'm excited to share more about that in an upcoming post. While I still have concerns about the tech industry and AI, I'm focusing on the practical experience and real-world impact I can make. Here's hoping for a strong finish to the year!
