This academic year, I'm serving as Secretary for Tech Connect, a new society I cofounded with two others after being invited. It's been rewarding to help build something from the ground up.

## What is Tech Connect?

A student-led networking society bridging the gap between students and tech companies. Our mission: get companies to network with students and vice versa. Building connections and understanding how companies operate is invaluable for students entering the workforce.

## My Role as Secretary

As second in command, I keep the society running smoothly. I manage a spreadsheet tracking all our external communications with organisations, including outreach, follow-ups, and meeting scheduling. I also schedule committee meetings and coordinate our committee, keeping everyone aligned. Supporting our president has given me insight into leadership and strategic planning.

## Recent Events

On 27th January, we visited Enigma Interactive, a web development studio on Newcastle Quayside. Our members got an office tour, learned how their company works, and networked with their team. Seeing their workspace and understanding project workflows provided practical knowledge you can't get in lectures.

## Upcoming Opportunities

This Friday (6th February), we're meeting with Leonardo at their offices to explore potential collaboration. We're also planning an event with Accenture in the coming weeks – having a global consulting firm engage with our society would be huge.

## What We're Hoping to Achieve

We want to build sustainable relationships with diverse tech companies in the North East and beyond. It's not just about one-off events but creating ongoing partnerships that provide continuous value to our members. By exposing students to different companies and work environments, we're helping them make informed decisions about their futures.

It's been a lot of work, but seeing members come away from events like Enigma with new perspectives and professional contacts makes it worthwhile.
