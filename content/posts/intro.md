Hi, 

The original version of this post was rather wet and soppy, and if you go hunting through this repo I'm sure you can find it. 

Tl:dr, this is gonna be where I write my thoughts. I'm not good at it, but I'm trying to do better, and hopefully it'll help me out in the long run. 

This being public is just a bonus, I guess. 

Ciao
