Hi, 

Starting something is always the hardest part, right? Or at least it always seems like it. It shouldn't be, logically, cause the start is when you're probably at your most confident yet with any project. 

At the start you haven't had your first roadbloack, that first big hump that seems so insurmountable that you near enough pack it in, but you manage to overcome it anyway not long after. Pushing the boat out is the easiest part of any journey, but it still feels so damn hard to do. 

It's *exactly* like writing this first post.

If there's one thing I'm consistently bad at, it's writing about myself and my accomplishments, so for me, even writing this first post is more trouble than it should be. I imagine it's probably quite similar for many people, though, but I think it's about time I actually start documenting myself, my thoughts, and every cool or silly idea I try before often moving on to the next thing that seems interesting.

So, if you're reading this, *thank you*. It truly means a lot, especially if we haven't met before.

Ciao
