# Welcome!

Hey! I'm Will, and this is my website. This is where I'll be documenting my:
- programming journey
- research projects 
- general musings about tech trends
- anything else that piques my interest

If you find anything I've written to be interesting, funny, or utterly captivating, feel free to contact me through my [email](william_hick@hotmail.co.uk) or discord (@guillermode).
