# Welcome!

Hey! I'm Will, and this is my website. This is where I'll be documenting my:
- programming journey
- research projects 
- general musings about tech trends
- anything else that piques my interest

I'm a third year Computer Science student at the Northumbria University, passionate about software, hardware, tech trends, and how they intersect with our daily lives.

If you find anything I've written to be interesting, funny, or utterly captivating, feel free to contact me through my [email](william_hick@hotmail.co.uk) or discord (@guillermode).
