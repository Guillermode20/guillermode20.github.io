    <h1>Third Year of University</h1>
    <p><em>Oct 20, 2025</em></p>
    <p>I&rsquo;ve made it to third year. The journey so far has been solid. I&rsquo;ve learned a lot and, despite some struggles, I feel I&rsquo;m on the right track academically. My career prospects, however, are a different story. The tech industry is brutal right now, and securing a good internship or graduate scheme has proven incredibly difficult.</p>
<p>Failing to land any summer internships or placements last year was a significant blow to my confidence. I&rsquo;ve been working to rebuild and refocus on my studies, but it&rsquo;s hard not to feel discouraged when the competition is so fierce and it seems like everyone else has more experience and better connections.</p>
<p>That said, I&rsquo;m determined to make the most of third year.</p>
<h1 id="what-im-doing-differently">What I&rsquo;m doing differently</h1>
<p><strong>Getting involved</strong>: I&rsquo;ve been accepted as a Programme Representative for my course, which is a great opportunity to contribute and make a difference. It&rsquo;s early days and I have a training session coming up, but I expect it will strengthen my CV and develop useful skills.</p>
<p><strong>Focusing my efforts</strong>: Over summer, I struggled by trying to juggle multiple projects at once, which only held back my progress. Now I&rsquo;m concentrating on one thing at a time and seeing it through before moving on. I&rsquo;ve chosen to rewrite <a href="https://guillermode20.github.io/projects/plotcypher/">PlotCypher</a> first, as my initial implementation was poor. I&rsquo;ll update my projects page once it&rsquo;s complete.</p>

<p><strong>Pushing myself academically</strong>: I&rsquo;ve always performed well, but this year I&rsquo;m deliberately stepping outside my comfort zone:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Group Project</strong>: I pushed for the project manager role in my group project module this semester. Four out of six people wanted the position, but I took the lead from day one by creating a GitHub organisation, setting up a Teams channel, and getting us organised. Managing people, especially those who don&rsquo;t pull their weight, has been challenging, but it&rsquo;s valuable experience. It&rsquo;s still early days, so we&rsquo;ll see how it develops.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Final Year Project</strong>: I&rsquo;ve selected an exciting project with real-world impact. A representative from B&amp;Q&rsquo;s Learning and Development Department approached the university seeking students to help modernise their truck driver training process. They seem genuinely open to innovation and want ambitious students to join their team. The project uses Unity, which I found difficult in last year&rsquo;s VR module, but I&rsquo;m excited about the challenge and the opportunity it represents. My supervisor has hinted at the possibility of an internship with B&amp;Q afterwards, which would be fantastic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Business Intelligence</strong>: This module covers BI tools and data analysis, a sector I&rsquo;ve never explored before. I&rsquo;m looking forward to learning more about it. I&rsquo;m planning to base my final assignment on B&amp;Q to tie it into my final year project and hopefully make a stronger impression on them.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="looking-ahead">Looking ahead</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;m cautiously optimistic so far. Balancing third year with the 20-25 hours of part-time work while also trying to secure a graduate scheme will be tough, but I&rsquo;m determined to make it work. My focus is on building a strong portfolio, gaining practical experience, and making meaningful connections in the industry. Here&rsquo;s to hoping that my efforts pay off!</p>
