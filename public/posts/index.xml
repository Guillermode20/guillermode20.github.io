      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve made it to third year. The journey so far has been solid. I&amp;rsquo;ve learned a lot and, despite some struggles, I feel I&amp;rsquo;m on the right track academically. My career prospects, however, are a different story. The tech industry is brutal right now, and securing a good internship or graduate scheme has proven incredibly difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Failing to land any summer internships or placements last year was a significant blow to my confidence. I&amp;rsquo;ve been working to rebuild and refocus on my studies, but it&amp;rsquo;s hard not to feel discouraged when the competition is so fierce and it seems like everyone else has more experience and better connections.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
