      <description>&lt;p&gt;I basically made this project because I found an app called &lt;a href=&#34;https://studioaaa.com/product/dither-boy/&#34;&gt;Dither Boy&lt;/a&gt; and didn&amp;rsquo;t really feel like paying for it. As much as I applaud indie studios like this for trying to make a neat piece of software all in one, the concept isn&amp;rsquo;t exactly novel and not particularly hard to replicate, however Dither Boy is absolutely a much better product. From just the videos I&amp;rsquo;ve seen it&amp;rsquo;s faster, can do videos and gifs, and applies the dithering effects much better.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This was my first big project I completed. It&amp;rsquo;s a React based daily media guessing game in the same vain as Wordle. It&amp;rsquo;s not particularly good, I was learning at this stage. Looking back there are a lot of changes I would make.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
